Howdy! My name is Atish Goswami. I am a Web Developer (mainly working on PHP). 
I like web designing / development and anything in between.

When I am not coding I spend my days with trying/experimenting in different areas of web development from back end programming (PHP, Django/Python, Ruby on Rails) to front end engineering (HTML, CSS, and jQuery/Javascript), user experience, server administration and visual design.

I am an outsource enthusiast, and mainly like working with PHP frameworks like [Cakephp](http://cakephp.org/), [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) and CMS's like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).

TechnoBlog is my outlet for talking about PHP development, Linux, JavaScript and anything else that I am interested in. I share code snippets, links, tips, tutorial and tricks and much more.
